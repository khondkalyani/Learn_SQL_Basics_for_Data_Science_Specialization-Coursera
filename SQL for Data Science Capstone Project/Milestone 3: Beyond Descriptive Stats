Relationships / Correlation, Pearson Correlation

Firstly, I computed Pearson correlation between Year and Female share of participants over 120 years to look at the trend of female 
participants. The Pearson Correlation of 0.961 shows a very strong positive relationship between Years and Female participation ratio, which 
indicates steady growth in women's involvement. 
I also computed Pearson Correlation between age of participant and his/her performance (i.e. Medal won) and it showed almost no linear r
elationship between athlete's age and the medal they win but age does influence performance in certain sports. 

Linear  Regression
The correlation between year and female participation ratio was very strong and positive (r â‰ˆ 0.97).The regression slope shows that female 
participation has steadily increased over time, meaning more women are competing in recent Olympics compared to earlier ones. 
As years progress, the share of female athletes keeps rising, showing a clear trend toward gender balance in the Olympics.

TF-IDF highlights the most distinctive words for each sport by giving higher weight to terms that appear often in one sport but less across
others. For example, archery is linked with words like target, round, team, while art competitions show painting, sculpture, architecture. 
This helps us quickly identify the unique language and themes that define each sport/event. 

I have initially missed to look for some points like to check if there is any association between the gender of participants and sports 
they choose to play. To dive deeper into it I calculated Chi-Square Statistics and the statistics suggests significant association between
gender and sport i.e.  male and female athletes do not participate equally across all sports.  
Looking beyond, this result suggests: Cultural and biological factors may influence the distribution of genders across sports.

Now, I want to look at some other things  like to check association between height of participants and sports they play also to check whether
all teams equally participate in each sport or not etc. with certain statistics and to observe the result  for better conclusion. 
With the help of descriptive statistics like chi-square test of fitness and independence, Pearson correlation and with some visuals or 
graphs we can find the result and interpret with it.

New Metric: Gender-Sport Participation Index (GSPI) 
This new metric helps to identify participation of female in each sport regardless of total number of participants in each sport. 
By calculating is showed some sports have almost equal participation of bit male and female players while some sports are dominated by only 
one gender(mostly male). Sports like Table Tennis, Badminton etc. have equal male female participants while some sports like  Water Polo,  
Weightlifting have almost no female participants as compared to male.  

New Metric:  Age-Performance Efficiency (APE)  
Measures how effective athletes in each age range are at winning medals. Helps test if younger or older athletes perform better across sports.
